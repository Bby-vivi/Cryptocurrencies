# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
>We created a report that includes cryptocurrenices on the trading market by grouping in a classification system. We utilized machine learning by unsupervised algorithms and grouped similar data into clusters.

 ### Tool/Resoruces
 
 *Jupyter notebook
 
 *K-means algorithm/elbow curve 
 
 *Unsupervised learning
 
 *Plotly/hvPlot
  
 
Created a new table. Dropped the CoinName column form the dataframe since it's not going to be used on the clustering algorithm
